# Exercise 1: Building an Asynchronous File Reader

## Statement:
Develop a console application in C# that asynchronously reads the contents of a text file and displays them on the console. The application should gracefully handle any exceptions that occur during the file reading process, such as the file not existing.

### Topics to Practice:
* Asynchronous methods and the await keyword
* Reading using streams
* Exception handling in asynchronous code

### Hints for Implementation:
* Use the System.IO.File class and its ReadAllTextAsync method to read the file contents.
* Encapsulate the read operation in a try-catch block to handle potential exceptions.
* Use async and await to perform the read operation without blocking the main thread.
